      """In the Lighthouse Project, my main focus is the Lighthouse web app â€” a powerful all-in-one, free-forever tool that helps you organise the various sectors of your life in a sustainable manner. The focus of the web app is to be "intelligent", automating as much of the administrative work as possible so that you can focus on actually completing your tasks. The web app is so feature-rich that I've also compiled a repository of documentation that guide the user through using different features of Lighthouse at different levels of depth. From bird's-eye-view for beginners to detailed feature-specific guides for the familiar, the documentation caters to users of all backgrounds. Further, elaborate guides detailing the design process and development decisions also make it easy for other developers to understand how Lighthouse came into being, allowing them to also improve on the product if needed.

From its inception in 2021 to its first stable release in 2024, the Lighthouse Project is one of my two flagship projects.""",

      """The Hyperion Project is a megaproject I started to explore the field of autonomic computing. At the time of writing in 2023, autonomic computing was a relatively new topic, just about ten or so years old. There were many studies about sub-topics in autonomic systems, such as AI/ML, distributed systems, and observability. However, research papers on the topic itself were scarce, so I wanted to kickstart R&D in this field.

Why autonomic computing? Well, I've always thought about the possibility of self-managed systems since I was a wee lad, but never once did I imagine that it was an actual area of research. After finding out it was, and that developments in the field of AI/ML bring us ever closer to that vision, I could not wait to start tinkering with code and conducting independent research on the subject.
